## üéØ **Core Technical Questions**

### **Q1: "Walk me through implementing Microsoft Defender for Cloud for your BFSI client."**

**Situation**: At Cognizant, I was assigned to lead the Azure cloud security implementation for a major BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) client who was migrating their critical financial applications to Azure. They had concerns about regulatory compliance and threat detection in the cloud environment.

**Task**: My responsibility was to design and implement an end-to-end Azure cloud native security solution using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), integrate it with their existing on-premises QRadar SIEM, and ensure the solution met banking industry security standards while being cost-effective.

**Action**: 
- Conducted a comprehensive security assessment with the infrastructure team in Azure Landing Zone
- Implemented MDC with both CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) and CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform) capabilities
- Configured MDC to integrate with their existing QRadar SIEM for centralized monitoring
- Set up automated security recommendations and compliance dashboards
- Implemented security policies aligned with banking regulations and internal security standards
- Created custom security benchmarks based on CIS controls and NIST frameworks
- Established a security validation process using BAS (Breach and Attack Simulation) platform with AttackIQ

**Result**: Successfully reduced cloud security risks by 18% through improved security posture validation. The client achieved regulatory compliance for their cloud migration, and we established a robust threat detection mechanism that integrated seamlessly with their existing security operations.

### **Q2: "Explain how you reduced MTTR from 24 hours to 1 hour using Azure Sentinel automation."**

**Situation**: While working at Cognizant, our SOC team was overwhelmed with security incidents that took an average of 24 hours to resolve. The manual investigation and response process was inefficient, leading to delayed threat mitigation and increased business risk.

**Task**: I needed to design and implement automated hunting playbooks in Azure Sentinel that could significantly reduce the Mean Time To Response (MTTR) while maintaining accuracy in threat detection and response.

**Action**: 
- Mapped common attack patterns to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand threat tactics and techniques
- Created automated hunting playbooks that could:
  - Automatically correlate security events across multiple data sources
  - Perform initial threat assessment and classification
  - Trigger automated containment actions for confirmed threats
  - Generate detailed investigation reports with recommended actions
- Implemented Logic Apps for automated responses including:
  - Blocking malicious IPs and domains
  - Isolating compromised endpoints
  - Creating incident tickets with pre-populated investigation data
- Set up automated enrichment using threat intelligence feeds
- Created custom KQL queries for pattern detection and anomaly identification

**Result**: Reduced MTTR from 24 hours to 1 hour, representing a 96% improvement in response time. This automation also freed up SOC analysts to focus on complex investigations rather than routine tasks, improving overall team productivity and threat detection capabilities.

### **Q4: "Describe your automation work that reduced manual endpoint security intervention by 40%."**

**Situation**: At Cognizant, the endpoint security team was spending significant manual effort on repetitive tasks like IoC (Indicator of Compromise) blocking, IP validation, and threat response for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) alerts across the enterprise network.

**Task**: I was tasked with developing automation use cases for the endpoint security team using MDE as the primary EDR solution to reduce manual intervention while maintaining security effectiveness.

**Action**:

## ‚ö° **Quick Technical Questions**

### **Q9: "What's the difference between CSPM and CWPP in Microsoft Defender for Cloud?"**

**Answer**: 
- **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)**: Focuses on configuration assessment and compliance monitoring. It evaluates Azure resources against security best practices, identifies misconfigurations, and provides recommendations for improving security posture. In my experience implementing MDC for BFSI clients, CSPM helped identify and remediate 18% of security risks through automated compliance checks.

- **CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)**: Provides runtime protection for workloads including VMs, containers, and serverless functions. It includes threat detection, behavioral analysis, and automated response capabilities. I've used CWPP features extensively for endpoint protection automation, achieving 40% reduction in manual intervention through automated IoC blocking and IP validation.

### **Q10: "How do you optimize Azure Sentinel costs for large log volumes?"**

**Answer**: Based on my experience handling 75 GiB logs/day for a client:
- **Data Retention Optimization**: Implement tiered storage with hot/cold data separation
- **Log Filtering**: Use data collection rules to filter unnecessary logs at source
- **Workspace Design**: Separate high-volume, low-value logs into different workspaces
- **Scheduled Analytics**: Optimize query frequency and data scanning ranges
- **Commitment Tiers**: Use Azure Sentinel commitment pricing for predictable costs
- **Data Archiving**: Archive old logs to cheaper storage for compliance needs

## üö® **Challenge Questions**

### **Q11: "Tell me about a time when your security recommendation was rejected by leadership."**

**Situation**: At TCS, I recommended implementing Azure Private Endpoints for all PaaS services for a cost-conscious client, but leadership rejected it due to the additional cost and complexity concerns.

**Task**: I needed to find alternative approaches to achieve similar security benefits while respecting budget constraints and gaining leadership buy-in.

**Action**: 
- Conducted a detailed cost-benefit analysis showing potential breach costs vs. implementation costs
- Proposed a phased implementation starting with the most critical services
- Demonstrated a proof-of-concept showing minimal operational impact
- Presented alternative solutions using service endpoints and network restrictions
- Created a risk matrix showing residual risks with each approach

**Result**: Leadership approved a phased approach starting with critical databases and storage accounts. Six months later, after seeing the security benefits and minimal operational impact, they approved full implementation. This taught me the importance of business-case development and stakeholder communication in security projects.
