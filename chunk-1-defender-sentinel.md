   â”œâ”€â”€ Executive Users (High-privilege, travel frequently)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Remote Workers (Variable locations, flexible hours)
   â”œâ”€â”€ On-site Employees (Consistent patterns, standard hours)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Contractors (Limited access, temporary patterns)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Service Accounts (Automated, predictable patterns)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Shared Accounts (Multiple users, complex patterns)
   â””â”€â”€ Privileged Accounts (Administrative, high-risk activities)

2. **Advanced UEBA Implementation:**

   // Custom ML-based anomaly detection for user behavior
   let LookbackPeriod = 30d;
   let AnalysisPeriod = 1d;
   
   // Establish behavioral baseline
   let UserBaseline = SigninLogs
   | where TimeGenerated between (ago(LookbackPeriod) .. ago(AnalysisPeriod))

       by UserPrincipalName;
   
   // Detect anomalous behavior in recent period
   let RecentActivity = SigninLogs
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(AnalysisPeriod)
   | where ResultType == 0
   | extend Hour = hourofday(TimeGenerated)
   | extend DayOfWeek = dayofweek(TimeGenerated)
   | summarize 
       RecentLogins = count(),
       RecentHours = make_set(Hour),
       RecentLocations = make_set(Location),

       VolumeAnomaly = abs(RecentLogins - AvgLoginsPerDay) / AvgLoginsPerDay,
       TimeAnomaly = set_difference(RecentHours, TypicalHours),
       LocationAnomaly = set_difference(RecentLocations, TypicalLocations),
       DeviceAnomaly = set_difference(RecentDevices, TypicalDevices)
   | extend 
       AnomalyScore = (VolumeAnomaly * 0.3) + 
                      (array_length(TimeAnomaly) * 0.2) + 
                      (array_length(LocationAnomaly) * 0.3) + 
                      (array_length(DeviceAnomaly) * 0.2)

## Question 10: Sentinel Performance Optimization and Cost Management
**Difficulty**: ðŸ”´ Advanced | **Category**: Optimization | **Experience**: 6+ years

**Scenario**: *"Your Azure Sentinel deployment has grown to ingest 15TB of data daily, resulting in monthly costs exceeding $400K. Query performance is degrading, with some investigations taking hours to complete. Design a comprehensive optimization strategy to reduce costs by 40% while improving query performance and maintaining security coverage."*

### STAR Answer:

**Situation:**

       | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
   ) on $left.Account == $right.UserPrincipalName
   | where EventID == 4624
   | summarize count() by Account

   // After: Optimized query with materialized views (3 seconds)
   SecurityEvent
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d) and EventID == 4624
   | lookup kind=leftouter MaterializedUserLookup on Account
   | summarize count() by Account

3. **Advanced Data Management Strategy:**

   Tier 1 (Hot - 7 days): Critical security events, high-priority investigations

   let HighValueEvents = dynamic([4624, 4625, 4648, 4656]);
   
   SecurityEvent
   | extend IsHighValue = iff(EventID in (HighValueEvents), true, false)

   .create materialized-view UserActivitySummary on table SigninLogs
   {
       SigninLogs
       | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
       | where ResultType == 0
       | summarize 
           LastLogin = max(TimeGenerated),
           LoginCount = count(),
           UniqueLocations = dcount(Location),
           RiskEvents = countif(RiskLevelAggregated != "none")
           by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
