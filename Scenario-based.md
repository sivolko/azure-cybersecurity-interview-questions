Question : 
As a cybersecurity architect, you are tasked with securing a business-critical legacy server that must remain operational until capital expenditure approval for system modernization. Given the constraints of outdated infrastructure, potential unpatched vulnerabilities, and zero-downtime requirements, what comprehensive security framework would you implement to mitigate cyber threats while maintaining operational continuity? Please structure your response using the STAR methodology, detailing specific technical controls, risk mitigation strategies, and compensating security measures that can be deployed within existing operational budgets.

Answer: 

**Situation**
We have a business-critical legacy server that must remain operational until budget allocation for upgrades becomes available. This server likely has outdated operating systems, unpatched vulnerabilities, legacy protocols, and potentially unsupported software components. The business depends on this server for operations, making any downtime unacceptable, yet its age makes it a high-risk target for cyber threats

**Task** 
As a security architect, I need to implement a comprehensive security strategy that:

- Minimizes attack surface and exposure to threats
- Maintains business continuity and system availability
- Works within existing budget constraints
- Provides layered security controls until modernization occurs
- Ensures compliance with security policies and regulations

**Action** 

Isolation & Segmentation 
Hardeneing 
Monitoring 

**Network Isolation and Segmentation**
- placed the legacy server in a **dedicated VLAN with strict firewakk rules**
- Implement network access control List (ACLs) allowing only necessary traffic
- Restric access to only authorised IP range and essential services
- Deploy a jump server/bastion host for adminstrative access
- Configure VPN-only access for remote admin task
- implement network monitoring with IDS (intrusion detection system) but this step might gonna add on extra cost on IDS so not affective as per our given scenarios .

**EndPoint/System Protection & Hardening**

- Install compatible endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols
- Configure host-based firewalls with deny-all default policies
- Implement application whitelisting where possible
- Enable comprehensive logging and audit trails

**Monitoring & logging** 

- Deployed host-based detection system (HIDS) like wazuh or siem
- Integrated logs with a central SIEM for real time alerting and anaomaly detection
- scheduled regular interfirty check with tools like tripwire

**Application Layer Protections**

- we can use reverse proxy or WAF to filter malicious traffic if the server is web-facing
- sanitized inputs and enforeced secure coding practices for any legacy applications

**Backup and Recovery** 

- automated and frequent backuos with offline storage
- implement versioned backups to protect against ransomware
- Document complete system configurations and dependencies 
- Test recovery procedure
